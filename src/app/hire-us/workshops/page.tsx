          <strong>Let’s Dismantle Ageism</strong> Designed for people of all
          ages and in all walks of life, this workshop raises awareness of what
          ageism is, how it appears in our lives, and what each of us can do to
          dismantle it. During our time together, you’ll see what it’s like to
          take or teach a workshop, and come away with all the tools you need to
          host your own. Also available as a DIY workshop kit.

            Still Kicking: Investigating the Intersection of Ageism and Ableism
          </strong>{" "}
          Worried about how your mind or body might change over time? That’s
          actually ableism, not ageism. Why does it matter? Because we age well
          not by denying those changes but by adapting to them. Still Kicking
          delves into the nature of ageism and ableism, where they differ, how
          they intersect and reinforce each other, and why it’s so important to
          dismantle the dread and dual stigma. Also available as a DIY workshop
          kit.

          <strong>Age Pride: Ageism and the Queer Experience</strong> Ageism
          (discrimination on the basis of age) is easy to overlook and difficult
          to untangle. It is compounded by other forms of prejudice, and
          LGBTQIA2S+ communities are especially susceptible to generational
          silos. Thanks to their unique life courses, though, queer people
          happen to be very well-suited to dismantle ageism and dispel any
          notions of intergenerational conflict. In this workshop, we will be
          exploring the intersection of ageism and queerphobia and how they
          combine and cause more harm together. We will learn to combat them,
          along with other forms of prejudice, to make the world a better place
          for everyone.

        <h3>Workshop Description:</h3>
        <p>
          Designed for people of all ages and in all walks of life, this
          workshop raises awareness of what ageism is, how it appears in our
          lives, and what each of us can do to dismantle it. During our time
          together, you’ll see what it’s like to take or teach a workshop, and
          come away with all the tools you need to host your own.
        </p>

        <h3>Time:</h3>
        <p>
          The workshop can be done in an hour. We like to have 1.5 hours if
          possible to allow for robust interaction and conversation. If you want
          a Q&A as well we recommend scheduling 2 hours. For groups with more
          existing awareness of bias the Q&As frequently turn into rich
          conversations where we all learn from each other.
        </p>
        <h3>Budget:</h3>
        <p>
          Presentations like these fund the other work OldSchool does. Our fee
          for a 90-minute recorded workshop is $3000. Our fee for a half-day
          recorded workshop is $4500.The recording is yours to share in
          perpetuity. However, we never want cost to be a barrier. If this fee
          is not accessible, tell us what your budget is and we’ll modify an
          offering to fit within it.
